# Student Roster App
## Julian Ramirez

## Introduction



This project serves as a basic student roster app. The program contains two classes (Student and Roster) and maintains a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. The program reads a list of five students and uses function calls to manipulate data. While parsing the list of data for errors in spelling or inconsistent data entries, the program creates student objects. The technologies used in this project are C++ and Visual Studio Community 2019. The application can improve by allowing user-generated input as well as integrating user authentication.

## User stories:
- As a school counselor, I want to update my student roster to reflect incoming students.

- As a data analyst, I want to use a student roster app to study student demographics by degree program.
